## 位移運算子
### 1. 性質
左移運算符 << 與 右移運算符 >> ，他們的效率是高於乘法運算 :

A good optimizing compiler will replace multiplications with shifts when possible.

### 2. Java 位移運算子的定義
1. The value of n << s is n left-shifted s bit positions; this is equivalent (even if overflow occurs) to multiplication by two to the power s.
2. The value of n >> s is n right-shifted s bit positions with sign-extension. The resulting value is floor(n / 2s).
   For non-negative values of n, this is equivalent to truncating integer division, as computed by the integer division operator /, by two to the power s.
* A << 1 等同於 A * 2^1
* A << 2 等同於 A * 2^2
* A << n 等同於 A * 2^n
* A >> 1 等同於; if A is positive:  A / 2^1.  if A is negative, floor(A / 2^1)
* A >> 2 等同於 if A is positive:  A / 2^2.  if A is negative, floor(A / 2^2)
* A >> n 等同於 if A is positive:  A / 2^n.  if A is negative, floor(A / 2^n)
